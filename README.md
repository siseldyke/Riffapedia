Must haves: search, random guitarist button, new pages brought up when clicking onto the guitarist with details,

full details of specific models of guitars within their pages, year, brand, model, avg price, in production or production stopped


must wants: background of guitarist page changes specifically to their band of fame (we want rage against the machine for tom morello, no disrespect to prophets of rage),
link to biggest/ or recent hits, (WATCH THE VOLUME)
random trivia generator for guitarist
