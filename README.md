Must haves: search, random guitarist button, new pages brought up when clicking onto the guitarist with details,

full details of specific models of guitars within their pages, year, brand, model, avg price, in production or production stopped

brand of guitar presented as:

then when clicked goes to page with the other models used, for example: gilmours strat, joe strummers telecaster, kurt cobains jagmaster



must wants: background of guitarist page changes specifically to their band of fame (we want rage against the machine for tom morello, no disrespect to prophets of rage),
